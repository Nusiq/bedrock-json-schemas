If your issue is about invalid JSON schema please use the template below. Before creating an issue please make sure that your file is valid (check if it works in Minecraft).

**File**
*Path to the file which returns errors starting from behavior pack or resource pack:
e.g. [behavior_pack\entities\player.behavior.json]*

**JSON path**
*Path inside JSON file that dosn't work poperly e.g. [minecraft:entity->components->minecraft:collision_box]*

**Additional context**
*Add any other context about the problem here.*

If possible please also add an example file that doesn't work. If it's valid it will be added to the list of exmples which is used to generate the schemas.
